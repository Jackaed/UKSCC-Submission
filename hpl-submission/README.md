# HPL Submission
Sam Ezeh

# Summary
We achieved a HPL run that achieved 1448.6 Gigaflops.

# Installation
To compile HPL we used the following script that uses the armclang compiler and
the Arm Performance Library which provides a BLAS implementation that is optimised
for ARM hardware.

```bash
module load libraries/openmpi/5.0.3
# module load libraries/openblas/0.3.27
module use /home/sezeh/hpl/arm-pl/install/modulefiles
module load compilers/armclang/24.04
module load armpl
flags="-ffast-math -funsafe-math-optimizations -march=native -mcpu=native -armpl"
rm -r hpl-2.3
if [ ! -f hpl-2.3.tar.gz ]; then
	wget https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/hpl-2.3.tar.gz 
fi
if [ ! -d hpl-2.3 ]; then
	tar -xvf hpl-2.3.tar.gz
fi
dir=$(pwd)
cd hpl-2.3
mkdir $dir/hpl-bin -p
export CFLAGS=$flags
./configure CC=armclang --prefix=$dir/hpl-bin # LDFLAGS="-lblas -lgomp -lamath -lm"
make -j16
make install
```

# Slurm Script

To achieve out best result, we used the following script
which we run using `sbatch -N 4 hpl-run.sh`

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

module load libraries/openmpi/5.0.3/armclang-24.04
start="$(date)"
echo Started at $start
mpirun ./hpl-bin/bin/xhpl

echo Started at $start
echo Finished at $(date)
echo Took $t
```

# `HPL.dat`
We use the following HPL.dat file which we constructed by building
on an autogenerated HPL.dat file. To tune the file, we increased the `N` value
to increase the problem size to as large as memory constraints allowed and
modified the values `P` and `Q` to reflect the the setup with 4 nodes, each with 16 cores
for a total of 64 processors.
